Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio for the UNCC Bootcamp course. It has several pages of information to showcase my skills as a full stack
developer. The main page is where you can find the basic information about me such as my Linkedin address. The Portfolio page has all the links the projects I've developed. The Resume page goes directly to a current copy of my resume. The Projects page provides a brief description of each project and the link my GitHub repository.   


**Motivation:** This portfolio showcases my progression in all the things I've learned since starting the bootcamp. No template was harmed in the making of this portfolio. Lots of CSS3! 

**Features:** hyperlinks, mobile-responsive, navigation bars

**Code Example:*
```css3
.div-label {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 40px;
    margin: 0px;  
    background-color: #aaa9ad;
    color: white;  
    width: 200px;
    height: 40px;
    line-height: 40px;
    font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
}

.imgPort {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px;
}


@media screen and (max-width: 980px) {
    body, header, footer {
        width: 100%;
    }
```
