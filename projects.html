                                updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The player must pick the same

                            <p class="pDescription">This is a trivia game using JavaScript and Jquery. The player will have 60 seconds to
                                complete the multiple questions about Presidents. When the player answers the 5
                                questions, or the time runs out, the score will be calculated and the player will have
                                the option to restart the game.</p>

                            <p class="pDescription">This is a game where the computer will pick a random number for you to match. You click
                                on the crystals, which each have a different random value, and you have to figure out
                                how to combine the values of those to match the random number the computer picked.
                                The values of the crystals are hidden from you until you click on it. You can click on
                                the crystals in any order and with as many clicks as you need until you either go over the
                                number or match the number. You have to figure out the values of each crystal based on
                                the total score. If you match the number, you win. If you go over the number, you lose.
                                Then the game resets back to a new random number and you can play again. </p>

                                command line prompts to take in parameters and return given data. It sends requests to
                                Bands in Town(concerts), Spotify(songs), and OMDB(movies). This program takes two
                                arguments. The first specifies the type of media to search, and the second specifies the
                                name of the concert, song, or movie to find. Optionally, the user can provide a single
                                argument that will make the program open the text file random.txt and read its
                                instructions from there.
